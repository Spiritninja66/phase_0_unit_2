		<tr><td>Array: 
An array is basically an ordered set of objects like strings, integer, fixnum, hash, symbol, and also other array objects. 
Arrays are simply made by using square brackets like these [ ]. We would use our objects in these brackets and separated by commas. 
["nine",5,6,9] in this array the string nine would be represented as object 0 zero. The number "5" is represented by 1 and so on. You would retrieve these values like this. 
Array [9,8,7,8 ]
A_array= Array[0] 
This will return the number 9 from the list. 
 Also you can use array.first or array.last as well. 
...
Now we shall look at Hashes! 
What is a hash and what does it do exactly?

A hash is similar to arrays. A hash manages collections of variables. The difference is that they are not stored in any particular way. To be retrieved they require some sort of key.  

To create a hash:

names= Hash.new
names [1]="havoc"
names[2]= "serenity"
puts names

So in this example we have assigned names as a new hash. From there we were able to add values to the hash. 

Another method is the store method.

names= Hash.new
names.store(1, "havoc")
names.store)2,"serenity")
puts names


From this we can see that arrays and hashes are similar but have their differences. Arrays automatically assign the variables while in a hash you would have to manually assign the variables. </tr></td>
		<tr><td>A loop is basically a way if telling your computer to repeat a process continuously, but you also need a way to stop the loop from continuing infinity. For that, there are different types of loops you can use.
Different types of loops:

while: this will test your condition and as long as the conditions are true it will continue running.
i=1 
while i<51
print "#{i}"
i=i +1
end

until: this loop is similar to the while loop. until will continue running as long as the statements are false. 
i=1 
until i>50
print "#{i}"
i=i +1
end

times: this can be used in any variable containing a number. 
3.times do
puts "I am awesome"
end
"I am awesome"
"I am awesome"
"I am awesome"


each: this one may be the most useful loop. It takes a list of variables and run a block of statements for each of them. 

# A list of names
names = [ "Fred", "Bob", "Jim" ]

names.each do|n|
  puts "Hello #{n}"
end

for: this is used if you know how many times you will be looping. 

for num in 1...10
  puts num
end

next: Is used to skip over certain steps in a loop.

i = 20
loop do
  i -= 1
  next if i % 2==1
  print "#{i}"
  break if i <= 0
end</tr></td>
		<tr><td>Ruby Vs. JavaScript

I mentioned last week that JavaScript is important because you can do so much with it. It is a language that is also very simple to learn. Ruby is also very similar. Ruby is described also as a computer language that is easy to learn. 
	Ruby has a bunch of libraries and codes that are useful for coding. It saves time because it allows you to write more with less. The syntax is simple and easy, it just takes a bit of trial an error to fully figure out. Everything in ruby is an object which is unlike most other languages. It was built to have a natural feel when coding. Because of that it also feels flexible.
