		<tr><td>I worked on a GPS this week and separate ones with some of my group. I had a good time. We stuck to the task at hand and did our best to complete the challenges as best as possible. Together we were able to finish the projects quicker and supply each other with the support and knowledge we each had. 

Solving the code is always the most fun and rewarding part. 

Sometimes I get stuck or lost and just feel completely inadequate compared to some of the other members in my group. The languages that we have learned are starting to get mixed up in my mind some times and it is difficult to sort them out with out refreshing my memory on the material. I was the navigator on the project. Some of my syntax was a bit off at times. I would forget where certain commas go and other important syntaxes.

I received some feed back from Rebecca last wee who over saw my GPS. Her feedback was helpful and revealed what I felt I needed to work on. I do need to review and work on the material more thoroughly. I need to vocalize my thoughts a bit more and express my mental processes as we are working on a project.
