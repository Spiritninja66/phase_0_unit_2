<b>Creativity: Why is this important to you?
Creativity is very important to me. It is one of the most important things I could have picked from the list. Whenever I think of superpowers, I always think of my imagination as my ability. For me, creativity is the core of my mind and thoughts. In paradise lost, Lucifer said that the mind is a place capable or turning hell into heaven and a heaven into hell. I believe that thoughts are just that powerful. We create our own hell if we do not know how to control our own thoughts. That is why creativity is important to me. It is an art form and control of everything. Like Neo learned in the matrix, everything is a choice. We choose what we do with every second of our lives. I feel for that people need to be creative. We need to be creative to even exist. Others call creativity madness, madness that some of us dive into and struggle to return to the shores of sanity just to tell of our tales.

	I am a writer. I havent had time to write much but code lately, but I still do think of my stories. I love to read, and readers think it is more fun to live multiple lives rather than just one. I feel the same as a writer. But as a writer you actually get to put yourself into the skin of the characters you create. This alone I feel is an amazing process. Honestly, with out creativity, I dont know what I would be. I feel it is something that defines me. I was never into computers before, but I feel that it can serve as a new medium to be creative. </b>

My sister asked me for a good lie to get out of work. Lying is not the best thing to be helping out on, but I do feel it covered all of the above values.
