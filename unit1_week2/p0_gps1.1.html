    <tr><td> <b>JQ Thoughts:</b> My first experience with GPS was very useful. It taught me the value of each role in the partnership. When a navigator can be as clear and decisive as possible it allows for the driver to be able to write effective and efficient code in a way that allows for the team to accomplish their goals outlined in their wireframe.</td>
    <tr><td> <b>KB Thoughts:</b> I found Guided Pair Programming very useful. It allowed John and I to collaborate on one project that combined both of our knowledge. I like switching back and fourth between driver and Navigator because it really helped us put our ideas together. In a pair we were able to organize our thoughts and keep everything in an ordered structure. Basically the Navigator tells or describes to the Driver what they should be coding. This is useful for working on projects.  </tr></td>

    <tr><td><b>Discussion:</b> The role of Navigator and Driver are extremely important to our teams ability to complete the task. It allows for two people to focus on the same code but different aspects. One person will focus on the content (Driver), the other on the organization (Navigator).</tr></td>
    <tr><td> <b>JQ Discussion:</b>Each role presented different challenges. As the navigator I wanted to make sure I was giving instructions that the driver would like and as the driver I wanted to write the best code that I knew the navigator would like. It became a challenge to make sure I put my best foot forward in each role. Yet the role that I liked the most was the navigator. I feel that once you and your partner have set the ground work in the wireframe that the instructions are fairly straight forward for the navigator to give. </td>
    <tr><td> <b>KB Discussion:</b>Pairing is done between two people only to prevent groupthink but also to push to completion of projects at a faster pace. Basically the Navigator tells or describes to the Driver what they should be coding using the wireframe that had been put together. I enjoyed both Driving and Navigation, but I preferred Driving overall. I enjoyed analyzing the information that I received from the navigator.</tr></td>

    <tr><td> <b>JQ Reflection:</b> Pairing for the first time was in heinsight a great learning experience. Upon completing our hour with Rebecca we both continued to work until our project was finished. Without having to designate roles we were able to just naturally cover the material as asked in a very formidable way. During our session I felt that we were a little lost and confused. Yet it felt like as soon as we got off the computer and back into our environment the tips that were suggested to us were just naturally put to use. </td>
    <tr><td> <b>KB Reflection:</b> I enjoyed GPS. It was good to get an understanding of what GPS is how it works. Working with another person was a fairly new experience for me. I am used to just solo work. But it was good having two minds on one project. I am excited to GPS on the future assignments. </tr></td>
