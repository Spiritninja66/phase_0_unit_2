			<tr><td> Why is JavaScript so popular? </tr></td>

<tr><td>I have been researching this question all morning and believe I have discovered the secret to the popularity! </tr></td>

<tr><td>In most of the articles I have found, JavaScript is said to be one of the easiest languages to learn! It is fast. And the libraries! Sadly they aren't libraries with books but they are close enough! </tr></td>

<tr><td>We will start with how JavaScript is easy to learn. The language is standardized and it is flexible. It is used widely which is why it is important for a programmer to learn. It also works better than previous programming languages which is why it is still around. Other languages are also built on top of it! </tr></td>

<tr><td>JavaScript is also easy to edit. Why? You may ask. JavaScript is written in plain text! You don't need any complicated programs to write it in! </tr></td>

<tr><td>There are many tools today that allow you to glance at JavaScript codes in websites you may visit on a day to day basis! I used tools like this to help me learn as well pick up a few tricks in my own coding style. </tr></td>

<tr><td>Going back to how easy JavaScript is, it is pretty simple to debug programs. The same tools used to look at others codes can be used on your own code to identify problem areas within the code. You can also choose to test small parts of the code at a time.</tr></td>

<tr><td>I mentioned libraries earlier. One of the more popular ones are jQuery. These libraries help make the more complicated parts of JavaScript easier to use. The libraries support JavaScript And make it easy to work in web pages with just a few lines of code. </tr></td>

<tr><td>These are just some of the basics I why JavaScript is so popular. It is easy to use and learn. Easy to debug. And it works fluidly when programmed correctly. </tr></td>
