		<tr><td>People are idiots and everyone lies. When I think of emotional conflicts, it always comes back to the way my friends pretend to be concerned about each other when in reality most of them are manipulative liars. 
	Everyone puts their priorities ahead of themselves, even if their priorities are to do nothing at all. I once had a group of friends that just let me down on their promises when I genuinely needed help with some work and a second set of eyes to glance over on an essay. I sent my essay to them weeks in advanced and reminded them. They just ignored me and then didn’t bother. There were plenty of times I would go above my means to help them with their work, even if I was busy. Then they ignored me time and time again. So I yelled at them and made it a point never to talk to them again. 
	The source of conflict is always the same. Other people and how I perceive them. I felt betrayed and then lashed out. Anger is always my first reaction. Then I isolate myself and stay silent with my anger.
	I don’t handle my conflicts well. I do what I instinctively feel needs to be done. I don’t like stressing over useless matters, even if it should matter.
	My actions made the conflict a lot worse, but it gave me resolve. The lesson I learned was that you have to let go of the little things. Maybe I didn’t have to get angry. I didn’t have to push people away. 
	If I went back and could do this all over again with what I know, I would do things a lot differently. I would have just accepted those people for who they were and who they were becoming instead of fighting their nature. I would have just talked things out. I wouldn’t have lost as many friends as I have. 
	I’ve learned that my anger destroys things. That is probably the one thing that anger is good at doing. 
	After reflecting, maybe I know how to handle myself better in the world. Maybe I should explain myself more to people. I am just not good at expressing myself at times. That is something I should work on.
