<br><p2>These three sites I find myself using the most.  </p2>
<p3>On Tumblr: I am instantly drawn to the cinter of the page. All of my news feed gravitates directly to the center of the page as I scroll down.The further back I stand, The more I notice the top bar that allows me to post different links to the site. the website is pretty simple, plain, but complex, there is a lot of space. organized. Some of the images and Gifs appear small on the page. I don't think that is the websitesfault, but more on the users. From the homepage, or anypage, it is super simple to find what you are looking for. It is very easy to browse through all of the content on the page. I enjoy using this site because there is a lot more freedom compared to what I have felt from other sites. From this site, I feel it is easier to find things that make me laugh or topics to think about. Other sites, like facebook aren't really the same for me.</p3>
