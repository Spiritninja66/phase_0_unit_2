<tr><td><strong>These three sites I find myself using the most.</strong> </tr><td>
<tr><td>On Tumblr: I am instantly drawn to the cinter of the page. All of my news feed gravitates directly to the center of the page as I scroll down.The further back I stand, The more I notice the top bar that allows me to post different links to the site. the website is pretty simple, plain, but complex, there is a lot of space. organized. Some of the images and Gifs appear small on the page. I don't think that is the websitesfault, but more on the users. From the homepage, or anypage, it is super simple to find what you are looking for. It is very easy to browse through all of the content on the page. I enjoy using this site because there is a lot more freedom compared to what I have felt from other sites. From this site, I feel it is easier to find things that make me laugh or topics to think about. Other sites, like facebook aren't really the same for me.</tr></td>
<tr><td>I go to Deviant art a lot because it is a community of different artist: Writers, digital artists, comic artists. I enjoy going through the works and giving my personal feedback on the work. When I go to the home page I am drawn to the center of the page, just like tumble. The center of the page they display the current artwork. A reoccurring theme is the center of the page and how important it is to stay organized. The website is very organized, simple but also complex, and pretty. I like the color schemes and how well they go together. The basic lay out doesn’t take away from the content of the page. The page is very easy to use. You can navigate though it relatively quickly. I feel really happy looking through the website for a while. The content is amazing and very well organized. </tr></td>
<tr><td>I like serebii.net. I am a gamer and one of my favorite consoles have always been the Nintendo handhelds. One of my all time favorite games have been the pokemon games that I revisit from time to time. Serebii.net is the site I use for info on the game, certain statistics within the game, and just a basic news feed for upcoming events. 
The site is a bit cluttered. The center of the page is important with their news feed. But the side bars feel like they can be organized better based on the more relevant content. It is organized but in an order I don’t prefer. The colors are simple on the site. Browsing the site can be difficult. A lot of things are not organized too well especially when it comes to different generations of games. I normally can navigate fairly well on the site, but it does take time. Order is very important overall.
