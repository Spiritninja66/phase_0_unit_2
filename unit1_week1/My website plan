My website plan:
I want a website where I can really try out what I have learned so far. 
I want to practice more with css and play around with different styling methods. I don't know what the site should be about. Since it technically is a monster, I might use that to inspire me. I am thinking of a somewhat frankenstein themed page. I want a side bar and main content in the center of the page. That is my main goal. Hopefully I can accomplish that much.
